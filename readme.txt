GPS Sonar Bleep PWA Installation
--------------------------------

1. From Chrome or similar browser > add to Home Screen or Install App [could also just run it from link]
2. Start Audio to Check for Sound.
3. If Sound is On, then
4. Lock GPS Position.
5. Move away from lock position and should gradually hear the Bleep getting slower.
6. Adjust all other settings to your preferences.
7. This is still in progress, however drop me a line for help or ideas:
8. Midi is still under development, however you can try it as is. 
9. A workaround is necessary for mobile. Desktop should work as is too.
